## 🏥 Project 1: Hospital Emergency Triage System

### 🎯 Goal

Simulate how patients are handled in a hospital emergency system.

---

### 📦 Input

An array of patients:

Each patient has:

* `name`
* `severity` (1 → 5)
* `hasData` (true / false)
* `condition` → `"normal" | "critical"`

---

### ⚙️ Processing Rules

#### 1. Validate patient

* If `hasData === false`:

  * Skip patient
  * Add to `missingDataList`

---

#### 2. Priority rules

* If `condition === "critical"`:

  * Send directly to treatment list (`treatedImmediately`)
* Otherwise:

  * Sort by severity (highest first)

---

### 📤 Output

Return:

* treatedImmediately list
* normalTreated list (sorted by severity)
* missingDataList
