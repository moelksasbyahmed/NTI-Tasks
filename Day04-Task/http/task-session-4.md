# 🧾 Assignment: Library Book Management API

## 📖 Objective

Build a simple REST API using **Node.js HTTP Module** (without Express) to manage a library's books.

All book data should be stored inside a JSON file (`books.json`).

Use only the following built-in modules:

* `http`
* `fs`
* `path`

---

# 📚 Book Object Structure

Each book should have the following properties:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Clean Code",
  "author": "Robert C. Martin",
  "price": 450,
  "available": true
}
```

> **Note:** The `id` should be generated automatically by the server.

---

# 📂 Data Storage

Create a file named:

```text
books.json
```

Store all books inside this file as a JSON array.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Clean Code",
    "author": "Robert C. Martin",
    "price": 450,
    "available": true
  }
]
```
